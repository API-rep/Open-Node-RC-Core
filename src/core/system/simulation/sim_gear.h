/******************************************************************************
 * @file  sim_gear.h
 * @brief SimProc function — speed-based virtual gear FSM.
 *
 * @details Two-level public API:
 *
 *   1. FSM primitives (`sim_gear_fsm_init`, `sim_gear_fsm_update`):
 *      Pure RPM → gear logic, no ComBus involved.  Useful for explicit reset
 *      (e.g. on runlevel transition) or direct use outside a SimProc.
 *
 *   2. SimProc function (`sim_gear_fn`):
 *      Output processor — reads `value` to derive RPM, runs the FSM,
 *      sets `value = gear` (written to outCh = `GEAR` by the channel mechanism),
 *      and writes per-gear ramp time to `TRACTION_RAMP_BUS` and sub-gear index
 *      to `SUBGEAR_BUS` as side effects.  Does NOT set `claimed`.
 *      Intended as the sole proc in a dedicated SIM_GEAR channel (outCh = GEAR).
 *
 *   3. SimProc function (`sim_apply_ratio_fn`):
 *      Shift-delta processor — will apply accumulated `shiftDelta` RPM drops
 *      to the throttle signal on each upshift.  Currently a no-op passthrough
 *      pending implementation.
 *
 *      Assign to `SimProc::fn`.  Pair with `GearProcCfg` in `SimProc::cfg`
 *      and `GearFsmState` in `SimProc::state`.  Self-inits on first call
 *      when `state->gear == 0` (zero-init sentinel).
 *
 *      Typical placement: last proc in the chain — other procs (bypass, ramp)
 *      already handle the `value` pipeline; gear is a pure side channel.

/**
 * @brief Gear FSM SimProc — reads RPM_BUS magnitude, runs the FSM, sets `value = gear`.
 *
 * @details Matches the `SimProcFn` signature.  Self-inits on first call when
 *   `state->gear == 0` (zero-init sentinel).
 *
 *   Actions per cycle:
 *   - Reads `value` (= RPM_BUS magnitude, seeded by SimChannel from inCh).
 *   - Gates RPM to 0 when `DRIVE_STATE_BUS` indicates reverse or standing
 *     (forces gear 1 — no conversion from ComBus position needed).
 *   - Runs the N-gear FSM (upshift / downshift / sub-gear toggle and step).
 *   - Sets `value = gear` — written to outCh (= GEAR) by the channel mechanism.
 *   - Writes sub-gear index (0 = inactive) to `SUBGEAR_BUS` (side effect).
 *
 *   Does NOT set `claimed` — not applicable when used as sole proc.
 *   Ramp-time update is handled by the following `sim_gear_ramp_fn` proc.
 *
 * @param proc    SimProc descriptor — `cfg` cast to `GearProcCfg*`,
 *                `state` cast to `GearFsmState*`.  Neither may be nullptr.
 * @param value   In: RPM magnitude from RPM_BUS [0..maxRpm].  Out: active gear (1..N).
 * @param bus     Read for DRIVE_STATE_BUS + SUBGEAR_* digital channels;
 *                written for SUBGEAR_BUS.
 * @param claimed Not modified.
